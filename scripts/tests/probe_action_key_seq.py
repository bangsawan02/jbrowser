"""Probe: capture the REAL remote's action-key event sequence for a long press.

The "long press also fires a click, so the page navigates" bug is intermittent and only happens
with the physical remote (a synthetic `adb --duration` hold is clean). The instrumented
CursorController logs the raw action-key event sequence of each press
("d23(r0) u23 ..." = DOWN keycode 23 repeat 0, UP keycode 23 ...). This probe:
  1. loads assets/longpress_log.html (a full-screen link that records the DOM pointer/click
     sequence into the toolbar title, with click's preventDefault so the page never navigates
     away and we can still read it),
  2. turns the cursor on,
  3. clears logcat,
  4. waits a fixed window while the USER does a real long press on the remote,
  5. dumps the Cursor: log lines (the event sequence) + the DOM event log + a screenshot.

Run it, then on the remote HOLD the OK/select button for ~1.5 s (a deliberate long press).
Repeat a couple of times during the window if the first is clean (the bug is intermittent).
